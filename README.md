# Medi-Check

A societal transformation is taking place whereby healthcare professionals, and patients alike, are shifting from reactive
to predictive health care management. Rather than waiting for health problems to be manifested as life threatening
conditions, new AI technology enables prediction of future health problems using datasets of patient information.

The transformation in health care management, coupled with new machine learning models have created an opportunity
for your software development company to develop applications for this lucrative medical sector. The objective of your
start-up is to develop a bespoke system which predicts the likelihood of someone contracting the serious medical
conditions of heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s.

Utility tokens are now frequently used to fund start-ups. As a method of fundraising your start-up, the team will use an
ICO (Initial Coin Offering) to develop a crypto utility token, **Medi-Coin**. This new crypto will be built on top of the
Ethereum blockchain and will be used to purchase services offered by **Medi-Check**.

The system consists of the key features outlined below.

**FEATURES:**

To develop the **Medi-Check** system, several applications are required:
* An android app, Medi-App, that enables patients and doctors, to calculate risk of illness based on lifestyle and
prior medical history
* A portal website, Medi-Web, for medical professionals.
* Machine learning models, based on internationally available medical datasets, will be developed to implement
the backend AI (Medi-predict).
* A simple blockchain and ICO

**Medi-App** basic features should include:
* Register/login: email and/or social media login option and accounts.
* Record details of patients GP
* Record details of insurance company
* Payment of insurance premium using **Medi-Coin**
* Medical History: detailed forms capturing the information requirement by the machine learning models in **Medi-Predict**.
* **Medi-AI** Interface based on the user’s profile, **Medi-Predict** may be called to determine thepatient's risk of contracting a range of illnesses.
* Request professional ability to call the GP, or insurance company on record, from within the app
* Support forms to contact the insurance company or medical professional
* Ratings & reviews. Capability of rating the quality of the app and leaving reviews of the app’s performance

**Medi-Web** basic features should include:
* Registration of medical professionals using email and/or social media login
* Access Restrictions: professionals should only be able to see the details of their own patients
* Medi-predict Interface allows professionals to view their patient risk profiles
* User Profiling enables medical professionals to run reports establishing levels of risk for all categories
* Aggregation of new patient data. Using new patient information, the administrator should have an option tocreate and export new datasets by extending those used by Medi-AI.

**Medi-Predict** basic features should include:
* Simple API linking **Medi-Predict** backend with the **Medi-App** and **Medi-Web** applications
* Models, using publicly available datasets, which determine patient risk of heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s
* Reporting which displays the accuracy of each of these models
