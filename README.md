**Medi-Check**

A societal transformation is taking place whereby healthcare professionals, and patients alike, are shifting from reactive
to predictive health care management. Rather than waiting for health problems to be manifested as life threatening
conditions, new AI technology enables prediction of future health problems using datasets of patient information.

The transformation in health care management, coupled with new machine learning models have created an opportunity
for your software development company to develop applications for this lucrative medical sector. The objective of your
start-up is to develop a bespoke system which predicts the likelihood of someone contracting the serious medical
conditions of heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimerâ€™s.

Utility tokens are now frequently used to fund start-ups. As a method of fundraising your start-up, the team will use an
ICO (Initial Coin Offering) to develop a crypto utility token, Medi-Coin. This new crypto will be built on top of the
Ethereum blockchain and will be used to purchase services offered by Medi-Check.
